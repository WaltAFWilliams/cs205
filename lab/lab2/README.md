# Lab 2

* Experimenting with critical sections in shared memory programming
* OpenMP locks (mutex)
* The `#pragma omp critical` construct
* The `#pragma omp atomic` construct
* Benchmarking these options.  Are some of them more expensive than others?
* Plotting results on remote computers using, e.g. `gnuplot` or `python`
