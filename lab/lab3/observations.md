Although two threads with IDs tid and tid+1 are likely to share the same cache line for their access into the array, the update rule in line 4 ensures that each thread updates a different element of the array. Since the updates are non-overlapping, there will be no conflicts in updating the array elements, and false sharing will not occur.

THe graph shows better performance for the padded array from k=1 to k=10, then the two shows same performance. At k, there seems to be less conflict misses.

The padded version behaves differently because the data in the array is aligned to a different set of cache lines, reducing the frequency of cache line evictions and reloading. This makes the computation run faster and mitigates the anomalous behavior for small values of k.
